    <h1>Hello! I’m Walker, a developer based in Charleston</h1>
    <p>I enjoy building tools that automate workflows and enable creative problem-solving.</p>

Since graduating, I’ve been working at Mediterranean Shipping Company, where my role spans scaling processing through automation and building internal tools that streamline procurement and operational workflows.</p>
    <p>Working in a global organization has given me the opportunity to collaborate with teams of all sizes across multiple regions, sharpening both my technical and communication skills.
