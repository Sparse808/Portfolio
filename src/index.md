# Hello! I’m Walker, a developer based in Charleston 

I enjoy building tools that automate workflows and enable creative problem-solving.

I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Georgia Southern University, with a concentration in software engineering. Since graduating, I’ve been working at Mediterranean Shipping Company, where my role spans scaling processing through automation and building internal tools that streamline procurement and operational workflows.

Working in a global organization has given me the opportunity to collaborate with teams of all sizes across multiple regions, sharpening both my technical and communication skills. I focus on delivering practical, well-engineered solutions that bring measurable improvements to complex systems, particularly within the ocean freight and logistics space.
